sorta
=====

Some sorting algorithms and data structure implementations.

# Downloading and compiling

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/briansteffens/sorta
cd sorta
```

This will be packaged up as a library at some point, but it's not done yet.
For now, messing around with the library is done in the ```src/main.c``` file.
To build and run it:

```bash
make
bin/run
```

To run the testing suite, you'll need BCUnit. Then:

```bash
make test
bin/test
```
